# BikeLocker

## Project Description

BikeLocker is an iOS app created for the modern city biker. It will help you find and share information about bike parking around town. The information provided is from the Police Department of Vancouver as well as from the biking community itself. As a user, you can check where there are lockers available, whether they have been reviewed by other users and how safe it is to leave a bike there. You can also add new bike parking spots or add your review to existing ones.
